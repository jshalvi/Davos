Jumped right in and set up the project.  Created an HTTP package to handle
request parsing, and response construction.  Created the Request object, enum
types for Request method and HTTP version.  I started some basic parsing, and
am considering moving the job of parsing up into a static factory so the
Request object can be immutable.

Created a static RequestParser class which will parse an incoming request and
return an immutable Request object.  Completed unit tests and implementation
for parsing elements of the request line.  Next step is to parse the request
line as a whole and to get started on the Response object.

Read up on basic networking in Java and wrote a very simple HTTP server as an
exercise.  Spent an hour debugging an issue in which the client does not send a
final CRLF, preventing the server from breaking its readLine loop.  After some
research, I realized I misunderstood the spec, and the socket is expected to
stay open until the last CRLF is receieved, unless content-length is specified.

Completed the request parser for the request line, which should be enough to
bring up a basic server this weekend.

Built out the response and static file request handler, and associated tests.
Using these basic components I was able to succesfully start up a basic server
which serves up static text content.
