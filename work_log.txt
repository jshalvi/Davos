Jumped right in and set up the project.  Created an HTTP package to handle
request parsing, and response construction.  Created the Request object, enum
types for Request method and HTTP version.  I started some basic parsing, and
am considering moving the job of parsing up into a static factory so the
Request object can be immutable.

Created a static RequestParser class which will parse an incoming request and
return an immutable Request object.  Completed unit tests and implementation
for parsing elements of the request line.  Next step is to parse the request
line as a whole and to get started on the Response object.
