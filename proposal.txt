SE450 - Winter 2012
Project Proposal

For my final project, I plan to develop a basic web server framework and implement a simple server using this framework.  The framework will support a subset of the HTTP 1.1 standard, and will handle only static content.  If time allows, the framework will be extend to be an MVC web framework similar to Django or Rails.  The features are as follows:

	The server shall listen listen for requests on a port specified at run time
	The server shall support the following HTTP 1.1 requests: GET, POST, HEAD, and DELETE
		GET requests will return the desired resource
		POST requests will return the desired resource, with POST data logged in the console
		HEAD requests will return headers and be logged to the console
		DELETE requests will have no effect, but will be logged to the console
	The server shall handle unsupported requests gracefully
	The server shall support plain-text filetypes (html, txt, css, js)
	The server shall support the JPEG filetype
	The server shall support console logging
	The server shall support a generic server configuration mechanism
	The server shall support basic authentication
	The server shall support cgi scripts
	The server shall support cookies
	The server shall support cookie-based sessions

Optional (MVC web framework):

	The server shall support configurable URL dispatching to client controllers
	The server shall support client controllers
	The server shall support processing of Mustache templates for views

to me 
Yes. I was thinking java.net<http://java.net>.  Project okayed.  Fine with me.

Hi Radha,

Is your estimate for the web server project based on the use of a networking package like java.net<http://java.net>?  I planned to do it without such a package and am surprised it can still be done in under 1500 lines.

Either way, I also had an idea to make not just a server but a web MVC framework similar to Django or Rails.  The client programmer would configure a URL dispatcher, write controllers to handle specific requests, and write templates to output the view.  I would use a third-party library called Mustache to process templates.

My revised proposal is below, please let me know what you think about the feature list, and the use of the java.net<http://java.net> package.

Thanks,

Interesting idea as a project.  Needs both the suggested optional features (and others??) in order to make it of the scale needed to reach class project.  Great care needs to be taken to structure the code.  writing a dirty web server is too easy..
